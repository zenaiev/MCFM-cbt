This package gives MCFM-6.8 the ability to compute differential 
distributions of the ttbar cross-section in the MSbar scheme.

In order to provide this ability, this package modifies and adds
a number of files. It is assumed that the user has a standard 
installation of MCFM-6.8. For installation, please move the
MSBAR.tar.gz file to the root directory of the MCFM-6.8 installation.
The default for this is MCFM-6.8/. Extracting the pacakage here will
add and overwrite the files as outlined below:

* Changed Files
- makefile
- Bin/input.DAT
- src/Need/mcfm_vegas.f 
- src/Need/reader_input.f
- src/Need/writeinput.f
- src/Need/scaleset.f
- src/User/bookplot.f
- src/User/nplotter.f

* Added Files
- src/Inc/msbar.f
- src/Parton/dfdist_lhapdf.f
- src/Phase/dgen2m.f
- src/Phase/gen2m_ms.f
- src/Procdep/msbint.f
- src/Top/dmqqb_QQb.f
- src/User/nplotter_ttmsbar.f
- src/Need/scaleset_mpt4.f

After the package is installed, the user will either need to modify 
the makefile to include thier specific library settings or simply run
the Install script again. It should then be possible to compile the
modifications by running make.

Please note that the current version will only work with LHAPDF sets.

Use:
The user should set the following fields in the input.DAT file

* nproc => 157 - compute ttbar cross section
* part => 'tota' or 'msbr'
---- 'tota' computes the total cross-section
---- 'msbr' computes only the correction required to transform to the
        msbar scheme.

* msbr => .true. - turns on msbar calculation
* msbar (mscase) => 'y4', 'pt4', or 'm34' - flag to tell MCFM which
    distribution to compute.
