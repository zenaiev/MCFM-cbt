Installation patch file for mcfm 6.8
-------------------------------------

untar the mcfm-patch-X.Y.Z.tgz file ( where X.Y.Z is the relevant version)
int the base directory of mcfm

then simply run 

 ./cleanup.sh
 make

The mcfm-patch file contains ... 

TensorReduction/makefile
TensorReduction/ov/makefile
cleanup.sh
makefile
src/Procdep/realint.f
src/Procdep/virtint.f
src/User/gridwrap.cxx
README

NB: this version should be used for mcfm 6.8. 
    It will not work with mcfm 6.7, since the mcfm code structure itself
    has changed slightly
