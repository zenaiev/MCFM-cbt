These are instructions how to install MCFM with "advanced" addon '-cbt' for 
HQ hadroproduction with running masses (+ multi-differntial cross sections under development)

You need git installed (I store MCFM code modifications on github.com).
Then you need to download standard MCFM version 6.8 from their webpage.
Then run:
tar xvzpf ~/sven-msbarm/MCFM-6.8.tar.gz
cd MCFM-6.8
git clone https://github.com/zenaiev/MCFM-cbt
mv MCFM-cbt/.git ./
git reset --hard HEAD

modify Install, insert there path to LHAPDF library directory, to determine it run
lhapdf-config --libdir
./Install
(actually I also need to change set -> export and remove spaces around =)

make -j5

Then for me it reported error with missing ff library. I had to do:
cd QCDLoop/ff/
make
cd ../../
make

If no error is reported:
cd Bin
./mcfm

It should take < 1 minute and print among other lines this one:
# "Value of final tota integral is   250379.7298 +/-   875.7419 fb"
# updated on 14.06.2019 (tuned for charm)
"Value of final tota integral is  5566511.0691 +/- 82078.5139 nb"
