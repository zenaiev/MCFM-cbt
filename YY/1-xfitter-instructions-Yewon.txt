Create a new directory, e.g. 'xfitter', and go to it:
mkdir xfitter
cd xfitter

Get this installation script:
https://gitlab.cern.ch/fitters/xfitter/blob/master/tools/install-xfitter
Download it as a plain file (-> open raw -> save as, or copy and insert into a manully 
created file with the same name), store in the new directory, make executable with:
chmod +x install-xfitter
and run:
./install-xfitter PionCeres

It will take some time (~15 min) to install all dependencies. If it reports error with 
the yaml library, do what it suggests, i.e. install it using a dedicate installation script.
After the error reported, you need to source a newly created setup file before installing yaml 
(it sets the required gcc compiler):
source setup.sh
./xfitter/tools/install-yaml
(will take ~3 min)
Then it will suggest to source a newly created setup file, do it:
source setup-yaml.sh

Now continue with xfitter installation: go to xfitter directory:
cd xfitter-master
Proceed with configuring it: this was the step where the error with yaml was reported previously, 
in order to get the exact configure command just look at config.log and find there the command:
Now compile and install it:
./configure --enable-applgrid --enable-lhapdf --enable-apfel --enable-mela --enable-apfelgrid
make -j9 install
(will take ~5 min)
Try to run:
./bin/xfitter
If everything is fine, in ~60s you should see the lines:

End of Message Summary
Then everything is fine (this was not a PDF fit, but just one iteration with chi2 calculation).

If everything works well, try to logout, then login, and run it again. After each login, you 
need to source two files (one for xfitter and all other dependencies and another one for yaml):
source setup.sh
source setup_yaml.sh
cd xfitter-master
./bin/xfitter
Also try if you can recompile the code after a new login:
make -j9 install
